            <h2> The Heartbeat of Indian Cricket </h2>
            <p>
                Virat, my heart, my hero, and the epitome of passion, perseverance, and cricketing brilliance. I sit here, watching the years pass by, with a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes, knowing that the time is fast approaching when we might see you step away from the game we’ve watched you dominate for so long. The man who has brought so much joy, pride, and inspiration to countless millions — is now nearing the end of his illustrious career.
            </p>
            <p>
                For over a decade, we’ve watched you break records, push limits, and leave everything on the field. Your hunger for runs, your dedication to the sport, and your fearless spirit have been the heartbeat of Indian cricket. We’ve been there for every century, every chase, every iconic moment that defined the modern era of cricket. You have been the face of this generation — a warrior who never gave up, no matter the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                But now, as the years have slowly started catching up with you, as the body begins to show the wear and tear, we can’t help but feel a deep ache in our hearts. The passion in your eyes has never wavered, but we know, deep down, that even the strongest warriors must eventually lay down their arms. Your journey, though, is a testament to everything that is possible when one believes — not only in themselves but in the power of resilience.
            </p>
            <p>
                And yet, I still believe, with every ounce of my being, that there is one more peak left in you. One more moment of brilliance that will remind us of everything you’ve been — and everything you still are. The game isn’t done with you, Virat. Neither are we. The fire in your heart still burns bright, and it’s only a matter of time before you remind the world why you are and will always be one of the greatest to ever play the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you, Virat. For all the joy, the memories, and the inspiration. You’ve given us everything, and we will forever carry your spirit in our hearts.
            </p>
